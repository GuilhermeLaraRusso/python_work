# A single Python dictionary can contain just a few key-value pairs or millions
# of pairs. Because a dictionary can contain large amounts of data, Python lets
# you loop through a dictionary. Dictionaries can be used to store information
# in a variety of ways; therefore, several different ways exist to loop through
# them. You can loop through all of a dictionary’s key-value pairs, through its
# keys, or through its values.
