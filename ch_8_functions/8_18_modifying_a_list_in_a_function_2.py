# We can reorganize this code by writing two functions, each of which
# does one specific job. Most of the code won’t change; we’re just making it
# more efficient. The first function will handle printing the designs, and the
# second will summarize the prints that have been made:

def print_models(unprinted_designs, completed_models):
    """
    Simulate printing each design, until none are left.
    Move each design to completed_models after printing.
    """

        # Simulate creating a 3D print from the design.
        print("Printing model: " + current_design)
        completed_models.append(current_design)
