# Python’s range() function makes it easy to generate a series of numbers.



# The range() function causes Python to start counting at the first
# value you give it, and it stops when it reaches the second value you provide.

for value in range(1, 5):
    print(value)


# To print the numbers from 1 to 5, you would use range(1,6)
# If your output is different than what you expect when you’re using
# range(), try adjusting your end value by 1.
