# The input() function pauses your program and waits for the user to enter
# some text. Once Python receives the user’s input, it stores it in a variable to
# make it convenient for you to work with.

# For example, the following program asks the user to enter some text,
# then displays that message back to the user:

message = input("Tell me something, an I will repeat it back to you: ")
print(message)

# Sublime Text doesn’t run programs that prompt the user for input. You can use Sublime
# Text to write programs that prompt for input, but you’ll need to run these programs from
# a terminal. See “Running Python Programs from a Terminal” on page 16.
