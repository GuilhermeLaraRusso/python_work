# Sorting a List Temporarily with the sorted() Function
#
# To maintain the original order of a list but present it in a sorted order, you
# can use the sorted() function. The sorted() function lets you display your list
# in a particular order but doesnâ€™t affect the actual order of the list.


cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']

print('Here is the original list: ')
print(cars)

print('\nHere is the sorted list: ')
print(sorted(cars))

print('\nHere is the original list again: ')
print(cars)

# Notice that the list still exists in its original order at x after the sorted()
# function has been used. The sorted() function can also accept a reverse=True
# argument if you want to display a list in reverse alphabetical order.
