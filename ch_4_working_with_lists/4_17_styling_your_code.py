# When someone wants to make a change to the Python language, they write
# a Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP). One of the oldest PEPs is PEP 8, which
# instructs Python programmers on how to style their code.


# INDENTATION
#
# PEP 8 recommends that you use four spaces per indentation level. Using
# four spaces improves readability while leaving room for multiple levels of
# indentation on each line.


# LINE LENGTH
#
# Many Python programmers recommend that each line should be less than
# 80 characters.
# The PEP 8 guidelines for line length are not set in stone, and some
# teams prefer a 99-character limit.


# BLANK LINES
#
# To group parts of your program visually, use blank lines. You should use
# blank lines to organize your files, but don’t do so excessively. By following
# the examples provided in this book, you should strike the right balance. For
# example, if you have five lines of code that build a list, and then another
# three lines that do something with that list, it’s appropriate to place a blank
# line between the two sections. However, you should not place three or four
# blank lines between the two sections.
