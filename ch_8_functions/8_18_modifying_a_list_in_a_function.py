# When you pass a list to a function, the function can modify the list. Any
# changes made to the list inside the function’s body are permanent, allowing
# you to work efficiently even when you’re dealing with large amounts of data.
# Consider a company that creates 3D printed models of designs that
# users submit. Designs that need to be printed are stored in a list, and after
# being printed they’re moved to a separate list. The following code does this
# without using functions:

# Start with some designs that need to be printed.
unprinted_designs = ['iphone case', 'robot pendant', 'dodecahedron']
completed_models = []

# Simulate printing each design, until none are left.
# Move each design to completed_models after printing.

while unprinted_designs:
    current_design = unprinted_designs.pop()

    # Simulate creating a 3D print from the design.
    print("Printing model: " + current_design)
    completed_models.append(current_design)

# Display all completed models.
print("\nThe following models have been printed:")
for completed_model in completed_models:
    print(completed_model)
