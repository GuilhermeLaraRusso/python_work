# 8-14. Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a dictionary.
# The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It
# should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function
# with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a
# color or an optional feature. Your function should work for a call like this one:
# car = make_car('subaru', 'outback', color='blue', tow_package=True)
# Print the dictionary thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was
# stored correctly.
