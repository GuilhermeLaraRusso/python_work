# Nesting

# Sometimes youâ€™ll want to store a set of dictionaries in a list or a list of
# items as a value in a dictionary. This is called nesting. You can nest a set
# of dictionaries inside a list, a list of items inside a dictionary, or even a
# dictionary inside another dictionary. Nesting is a powerful feature, as the
# following examples will demonstrate.
