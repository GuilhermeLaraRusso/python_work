# Removendo um Item utilizando o comando 'del'

# If you know the position of the item you want to remove from a list, you can
# use the del statement.

# Removendo um item utilizando o comando 'pop()'

# Sometimes youâ€™ll want to use the value of an item after you remove it from a
# list. For example, you might want to get the x and y position of an alien that
# was just shot down, so you can draw an explosion at that position. In a web
# application, you might want to remove a user from a list of active members
# and then add that user to a list of inactive members.
#
# The pop() method removes the last item in a list, but it lets you work
# with that item after removing it. The term pop comes from thinking of a
# list as a stack of items and popping one item off the top of the stack. In
# this analogy, the top of a stack corresponds to the end of a list.
