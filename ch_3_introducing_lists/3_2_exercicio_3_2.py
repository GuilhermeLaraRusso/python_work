# 3-2. Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just
# printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message
# should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the
# person’s name.

names = ['Thais', 'Lorenzo', 'João', 'Rabello', 'Pedro', 'Leo']

print(names[0] + ', You are my friend!')
print(names[1] + ', You are my friend!')
print(names[2] + ', You are my friend!')
print(names[3] + ', You are my friend!')
print(names[4] + ', You are my friend!')
print(names[5] + ', You are my friend!')
